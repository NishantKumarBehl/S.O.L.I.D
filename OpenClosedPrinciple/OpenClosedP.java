    // in a constructor of a class that implments the interface
    // this class is called context class that can be extended into concrete classes
    // each concrete class implementing its own behaviour
    // that is why it implements behaviour design pattern called STRATEGY
    // since it also abstracts away the interface, creational design pattern
    // Abstract factory also follows OCP
